# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Porject
This repository contains the R script and documents of the project for the Coursera Data Science's specialization course "Getting and Cleaning data".

# Input Raw Data
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is used to this project.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# R script and documents description
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is the output tidy file.
